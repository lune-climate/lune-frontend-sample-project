# Getting Started with Lune Sample App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project runs with Node 20 and has been tested on Node v20.11.1. If you use `nvm`, run `nvm install` and `nvm use` to use the correct node version.

## How to start the project locally

1. Clone the project
2. Install all dependencies (suggested command: **yarn**)
3. Add the **Bearer Token** in the **.env** by replacing **"{PUT AUTH TOKEN HERE}"** with the actual value
4. Run the **start** script (suggested command: **yarn start**)
5. The application should now be accessible on **localhost:1234**

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you're unable to get the app up and running.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### *Cursor based pagination
Projects are paginated using cursor-based pagination. This means that, to get all objects, you must paginate through the results by providing the last project id as a `after` query parameter.
Each result includes a has_more boolean field. If this is true, then the next page requested will return additional results.
By default, each page returns 10 objects, however, by setting `limit` you can request up to 100 objects.
